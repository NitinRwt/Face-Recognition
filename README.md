- **dataset_creator.py**: Script for creating and managing datasets used for training the model.
- **trainer.py**: Script for training the object detection and recognition model.
- **detector.py**: Script for running the object detection model on images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
  pip install opencv-python-headless tensorflow numpy
```
<h2> 1. Dataset Creation</h2>
Use the dataset_creator.py script to create and manage datasets for training your model.
<h2>2. Training the Model</h2>
Train the object detection model using the trainer.py script. Ensure your dataset is prepared and located in the appropriate directory.
<h2>3. Detecting Objects</h2>
Run the detector.py script to detect objects in images. Update the script with the path to your images.<br>
